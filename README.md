# Handwritten Letter Classification

## Description

This project aims to classify handwritten letters using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten letters, with each image representing a letter from A to Z. The project involves data preprocessing, training a CNN model, and evaluating its performance. The model is also used to predict letters from external images.

## Files

- `data/`: Contains the CSV file with handwritten letter data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model training.
- `src/`: Source code files, including data preprocessing, model training, and prediction scripts.
- `images/`: Scans of handwritten notes and sample images used for predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.
